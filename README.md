The SVG image is a 2025 drawing of the core parts of a prototype machine for continuous graphene‑tether production. Parts not shown: ethanol vaporizer, take‑up reel, and argon gas chamber.

A graphene tether is currently the best way to build a space elevator. The space‑elevator concept offers low‑cost access to orbit by replacing fast rocket propulsion with slow mechanical climbing. Recent ideas (Gassend 2025) suggest using the tether as both a structural element and a power‑transmission medium for longitudinal waves traveling up the 100,000 km tether.

Lastest build is 9 mm wide and tested up to 500 °C.

Design Goals

100 GPa polycrystalline strength.

100 layers, with cross‑linking between layers to reinforce van der Waals forces and avoid graphite.

100 mm wide, up to 10,000 mm wide for multiple folds lengthwise.

1 km per day, up to 10,000 km per day with parallel industrial production.

Robust plug‑and‑play; just add electricity and Bacardi 151 (or less hepatoxic carbon precursor).
