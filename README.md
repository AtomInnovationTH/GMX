The SVG image is a 2025 drawing of core parts of a prototype machine for continuous graphene tether production, 24/7.  Ethanal vaporizer, take up reel, and Argon chamber are not shown.

A graphene tether is currently the best way to build a space elevator. The space‑elevator concept offers revolutionary, low‑cost access to orbit by replacing fast rocket propulsion with slow mechanical climbing. Recent ideas (Gassend 2025) suggest using the tether as both a structural element and a power‑transmission medium for mechanical waves traveling up the 100,000 km tether.

Updates and photos may follow as the working prototype improves.
